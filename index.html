                Coding is my new found passion!
            <br>
            <br>
                Wrestling was my "identity" throughout my education. If you know a wrestler, you know 
                they are obsessed with food. Growing up, I owned my wrestling identity and 
                embraced my "relationship" with food. These two driving forces are what navigated me to 
                earning my Nutrition degree from Ohio Wesleyan University. I always thought my life 
                would evolve around wrestling and food. But I kind of felt unfulfilled. I thought 
                Brazilian Jujitsu might me that next step for me but I wanted to 
                learn something different and outside my comfort zone.
            <br>
            <br>
                That is when it happened; that missing spark ignited the moment I "peeked" behind a 
                web page and began inspecting what every little piece of code impacted. Full-stack web 
                development calls to my passion; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and 
                even allows me to break it so I can improve it - in a separate Git branch, of course.
            <br>
            <br>
                I love applying responsive design principles and watching web pages react; it is 
                oddly satisfying. I guess you could say I a like a web page; I'm moldable, but I 
                still maintain my creativity intact.
            <br>
            <br>
                This is where I will update to include additionally learned skills as the class 
                progresses.
